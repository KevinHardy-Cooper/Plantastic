# Plantastic
Oh my stars, this project is plantastic!

## Overview
Summer Internship Project - Kevin Hardy-Cooper

A suggestion engine built with React.js, Node.js, MySQL, and utilizes the Google Cloud Vision API to upload and analyze an image of a plant from the user, and display relevant advice on how to take care of that plant.

## Prerequisites
1. You will need a package manager, such as [npm]. (https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. You will need [Node.js] to execute the backend. (https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. You will need [React.js] to execute the frontend. (https://reactjs.org/)
4. You will need a [MySQL] database instance on your local machine. (https://www.mysql.com/)
5. You will need to be familiar with Google Cloud Vision API calls. (https://cloud.google.com/vision/)

##### Helpful Tutorials
1. Getting started with Node.js, and integrating it with MySQL. https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/
2. Getting started with React.js. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/
3. Getting started with Google Cloud Vision. https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/label-detection-tutorial

## Installation
1. Clone this repo to your favourite local directory.
2. (At least on a Mac) _System Preferences_ Turn on MySQL database instance.
3. _Terminal_ Use command line to navigate to the /Plantastic/src folder.
4. _Terminal_ Use the following command: `node backend.js` to get the backend up and going
5. _Terminal_ Run the following command: `$ npm start` to start the frontend
6. _Your favourite web browser_ Open [localhost:8080] (http://localhost:8080/)
7. Your MySQL database that we will be querying is currently empty.  There are example queries in sample_queries.txt

## Live Demo?!
1. Once you have the MySQL instance going, the backend up and cruisin', and the frontend rockin' and rollin', hit [localhost:8080] (http://localhost:8080/), and upload an image of a plant (there are example images in /assets) for the suggestion engine to start givin' 'er!
